for the navigation bar i chose this design with the logo in it because when you start looking for the other pages of the website, its in your peripheral vision and is one of the first things you look at

I chose 2 different layouts for this website.  For the home page and history page have a standard layout with the header at the top with the navigation bar underneath and then the information on the page spilt into subsections while on the tourist page i used a 3 column layout since they are not ordered or ranked in anyway, i can therefore display all the information about each of the places side by side

For the colour choices i picked cold colours as the theme so i only chose colours like blue and black

The challenges i faced when creating this website were mostly deciding how to display the information for each page that looked the best for me.
